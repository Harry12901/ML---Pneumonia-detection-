Abstract:
<p>
Pneumonia is an Infection that inflames air sacs in one or both
lungs, which may fill with fluid. With pneumonia, the air sacs may fill
with fluid or pus. The infection can be life-threatening to anyone, but
particularly to infants, children and people over 65.
The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains
subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are
5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).
Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective
cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou
Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray
imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care.

The project aims to design a model that will be able to classify images into
pneumonia or normal with acceptable amount of accuracy.
